# arachnophobia-vr-mini-game
A VR mini-game to help people face arachnophobia

# Tools used to build and play this mini-game
Unity, GoogleVR (GVR SDK), and Google Cardboard

# Flow of the mini-game
When the user starts the game, the user is viewing a pair of spiders enclosed in six transparent-walls.

To gain points, which are tracked in the top right part of the scene, the user clicks on various assets in the game. There are two types of assets the user can click on: spiders and the transparent-walls enclosing the spiders. When the user's reticle hovers over these assets, the assets change color, which is a signal to the user that he/she can click on those assets. Clicking has a different impact on each type of asset: transparent-walls disappear while spiders move toward the user.

When the user's reticle hovers over the spiders, the spiders turn blue. After-click, the spiders move toward the user.

After the user has made all the transparent-walls disappear and moved both spiders forward, the user has gained 8 points. At this juncture, a larger spider drops down. The next step in the game is for the user to click on this larger spider.

In the last screen, the user can restart the mini-game if desired.

# Next steps
The next step for this project would be to create a series of mini-games that have increasing exposure to spiders. If the user is actually meant to face their fear of arachnophobia, the user should have increasing exposure to spiders in a controlled way.
